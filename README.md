# Tasthy

Join the worldwide developer community for an all-online program with exciting announcements, sessions, and labs at no cost. You’ll get a first look at the latest Apple platforms, tools, and technologies — so you can create your most innovative apps and games yet.

Tasthy Application is my submission of the Apple WWDC2021 Swift Challenge. It's about the application that can help you to cook Thai foods step by step in the COVID-19 situation. Many people in the world are quarantined at home. So I change my mind that why people think healthy is necessary for life. By the way, foods are the more one of necessary for life. I think an application that helps with teaching you to cook is useful. And I want to tell many people that Thai foods are delicious that they have to try.

## Technology used

- SwiftUI for design frame and application.
